A fun and interactive **"Simon Says"** game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates a sequence of colors that the player must memorize and repeat. With each successful level, the sequence gets longer. The game ends when the player makes a mistake.

2. Press any key to start the game.
3. Watch the color sequence flash on the screen.
4. Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the same order.
